# Transgender Health Care

Finding informed, competent and professional healthcare providers can be a challenge for the transgender community. Many in the community rely on networks of friends, scattered online websites, or even calling up offices to find healthcare providers that are willing to treat transgender patients. Even those who are willing often lack knowledge, and it's a fairly common experience for trans patients to have to educate their providers.

This project has two parts:

### The API 

This will use Python and MySQL to create an API to allow individuals and organizations to pull the data relevant to their communities.

### The form

There will be a simple form on a hosted website that allows anyone to submit the name, location, and details of their experience with a provider. 

## Get Involved!

I will be working over the next few days to set up the rest of the basic project structure and create issues for the work that needs to be done. I will also post instructions on how to get the project up and running on your local machine so that you can work on a feature!
